- Python files: 13 essential files
- Config files: 2 files (config/)
- Streaming: 2 files (streaming/)
- Documentation: 3 files

DISK SPACE:
===========
Approximately 120 KB (excluding dependencies)

HOW TO RUN:
===========

Step 1: Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 2: Start data simulation (Terminal 1)
   python simulate_all.py

Step 3: Launch dashboard (Terminal 2)
   python -m streamlit run dashboard_executive.py

Step 4: Open browser
   http://localhost:8501

IMPORTANT NOTES:
================

1. The 'venv' folder is NOT included - you'll need to create a new virtual
   environment or use your global Python installation.

2. All database credentials are pre-configured in config/config.py

3. For complete visual explanations of every chart and feature, READ:
   VISUAL_EXPLANATION.txt (contains ASCII diagrams of all dashboard components)

4. The dashboard requires both terminals running simultaneously:
   - Terminal 1: simulate_all.py (generates data)
   - Terminal 2: dashboard_executive.py (displays data)

WHAT MAKES THIS "CLEAN":
=========================

✓ Only production-ready files included
✓ No test files or old versions
✓ No unnecessary documentation
✓ Clear file organization
✓ Comprehensive documentation in 2 files (README + VISUAL_EXPLANATION)
✓ All code fully functional and tested
✓ Zero dependencies on excluded files

NEXT STEPS:
===========
